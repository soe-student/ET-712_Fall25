          Rubies are among the most valuable gemstones in the world, with large, high-quality rubies often 
          selling for more per carat than equivalent diamonds. The "Sunrise Ruby," a 25.59-carat Burmese ruby, 
          sold for $30.3 million in 2015, setting a world record for any ruby and any colored gemstone. Rubies 
          are made of corundum (aluminum oxide), the same mineral as sapphires, but it's the presence of chromium 
          that creates their spectacular red color. Ancient warriors in Burma (Myanmar) believed that rubies made 
          them invincible in battle and would actually embed the stones into their skin before combat. 
          Scientifically, rubies exhibit an optical phenomenon called fluorescence—when exposed to ultraviolet 
          light, they glow with an intense red color, making them appear to be lit from within. Myanmar's Mogok 
          Valley, known as the "Valley of Rubies," has produced the finest rubies for over 800 years. Perhaps 
          most intriguingly, rubies were used in the first working laser in 1960, and ruby lasers are still used 
          today in various technologies, from medical procedures to scientific research, proving that this ancient 
          gem continues to play a role in cutting-edge science.
