        <h2>Cleopatra's Favorite Gemstone</h2>
        <p>
          Emeralds have captivated humanity for over 4,000 years, with the first known mines located in Egypt 
          dating back to 1500 BCE. Cleopatra was so obsessed with emeralds that she claimed ownership of all 
          emerald mines in Egypt during her reign. What makes emeralds truly unique is that they're actually 
          rarer than diamonds—finding a flawless emerald is exceptionally difficult because nearly all emeralds 
          contain inclusions (called "jardin," French for garden) that formed during their creation. In fact, 
          these inclusions are so accepted that unlike diamonds, emeralds are rarely considered flawed because 
          of them. The mesmerizing green color comes from trace amounts of chromium and sometimes vanadium. 
          Colombia produces about 70-90% of the world's emeralds, with the Muzo mines being legendary for 
          producing the finest stones. Interestingly, emeralds are part of the beryl family, making them 
          siblings to aquamarine and morganite. Ancient Romans believed emeralds could soothe eyes and restore 
          vision, and the Roman emperor Nero reportedly watched gladiator fights through a large emerald to 
          reduce glare. Modern science has shown that the green color actually can reduce eye strain, so the 
          Romans weren't entirely wrong! The largest emerald ever found is the Bahia Emerald, discovered in 
          Brazil in 2001, weighing approximately 752 pounds and valued at around $400 million, though its 
          ownership remains disputed in what has become one of the gem world's most complex legal battles.
